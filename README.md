# Sample Repository for the Cognitive Services Speech SDK

This project hosts the **samples** for the Cognitive Services Speech SDK. To find out more about the Cognitive Services Speech SDK itself, please visit the [SDK documentation site](https://aks.ms/csspeech).

## Features

This repository hosts samples that help you to get started with several features of the SDK:

- [Speech-To-Text](../Speech-to-Text/overview.md)

- [Speech Translation](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/translator/speech.aspx)

- [Language Understanding and Intent Service](https://aka.ms/csspeech/luisdocs)

In addition more complex scenarios are included to give you a head-start on using speech technology in your dapplication.

We tested the samples with the latest released version of the SDK on the Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.4 platform.

## Getting Started

The SDK documentation has extensive sections about `Getting Started`, `Setting up the SDK`, as well as the mechanism to acquire the required `subsctiption keys`. You will need subscription keys to run the samples on your machines, you therfor should follow the instructions on these pages before continuing.

Once you have these keys, follow these steps:

### Windows

The sample require a working installation of the [Visual Studio 2017 IDE](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on your system (the community edition is sufficient). Then clone this sample repository onto your local machine, or download the [samples](https://aka.ms/winsample) and extract them into a local folder. For the various samples you find solution files (`*.sln`) you can open directly in Visual Studio 2017. Compile the samples inside Visual Studio,  the required Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK components will automatically be downloaded from [nuget.org](https://aka.ms/nuget).

### Linux
